# Tic Tac Toe "AI" Shenanigans

### What?
This is a little Java program to play tic tac toe versus an "AI" that is supposed to be unbeatable. Inspired by [Sebastian Lague's Chess AI video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk).

### Why?
I read a medium article about some guy getting a job by just giving a description of how he would create an unbeatable tic tac toe AI, which he was given a weekend to come up with.
I thought it was interesting that his idea was to use machine learning for something so simple so I set the challenge of doing something more elegant in a day.
Obviously, the code isn't the part that is elegant. The AI algorithm is too coupled with the game and the game is too coupled with the "graphical" presentation, but I focused on getting this done in a day so it is what it is.
