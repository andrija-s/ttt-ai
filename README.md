# Tic Tac Toe "AI" Shennanigans

### What?
This is a ittle Java program to play tic tac toe versus an "AI" that is supposed to be unbeatable. Inspired by much more complicated chess AI.

### Why?
I read a medium article about some guy getting a job by just giving a description of how he would create an unbeatable tic tac toe AI, which he was given a weekend to come up with.
I thought it was funny his idea was to use machine learning for something so simple (and he got the job anyway!) so I set the challenge of doing something more elegant in a day.
Obviously, the code isn't the part that is elegant. The AI algorithm is too coupled with the game itself, but I wanted to get this done in a day so it is what it is.
